            <h3>Step 1 — Canvas Setup</h3>
            <p>
                In this sketch I began by creating a 600 x 600 canvas, setting the background to white and adjusting
                stroke weight (sw) so it would more closely resemble the reference. I defined the value of ‘inset’, and
                drew a border around the parameter of the canvas using rect() where the x and y coordinates are set to
                inset. The reason for this is so that the full width of the border is contained within the canvas.

            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <img src="../Images2/setup.jpg" />

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 2 — Dividing the canvas into quadrants </h3>
            <p>
                First I defined the value of half (let half = width / 2 e.g. 300). I then used this value as well as the
                full value of width and height to draw two lines, one that divides the canvas vertically, and one that
                divides the canvas horizontally. The result is that the canvas is now divided into four equal quadrants.

            </p>

        <section class="step single-image">
            <h3>Step 3 — Drawing vertical parallel lines that fill the top, left quadrant </h3>
            <p>
                I defined the value of spacing e.g. the space between each line that will be drawn, and using the value
                of half, created a while loop that fills the quadrant with vertical parallel lines with 20px of spacing
                in between them. However, there was an issue where the spacing between where the lines begin and where
                they ended was not evenly distributed. E.g:

            </p>

            <div class="image-single">
                <img src="../Images2/3.png" />

        </section>



        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 4 — Centering the Vertical Lines </h3>
            <p>
                To resolve the issue of unevenly spaced lines I calculated a boundary by first defining a value I called
                ‘clearance’ (let clearance = spacing / 2 ), which is the value alloted the left and right side. Using
                this value I then defined a series of parametres that make up the quadrant, accounting for the left and
                right side of the quadrant to determine the usable width. Additionally, I created the offsetL which
                calculated how much the lines would need to be offset to compensate for the black border. This resulted
                in the lines having even spacing on either side of them.

        </section>


        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 5 — Drawing horizontal parallel lines in the top, right quadrant</h3>
            <p>
                I created a while loop that fills the top right quadrant with horizontal, parallel lines. I needed to
                centre the lines so there was even spacing at the top and bottom of the quadrant in a similar manner to
                what I had done previously:
            </p>

                <img src="../Images2/top-right.jpg" />

            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="step single-image">
            <h3>Step 6 — Drawing diagonal lines in the bottom, left quadrant</h3>
            <p>
                I implemented a while loop to draw diagonal lines across the bottom left quadrant. The diagonal line is
                achieved by the two coordinate points for each line, which increase while maintaining the same
                difference to create parallel diagonal lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                This however created multiple changes where initially the lines exceeded their designated area and the
                spacing between lines appeared smaller.
            </p>

        <section class="step single-image">
            <h3>Step 7 — Implementing Clipping Contraints</h3>
            <p>
                To solve the issue of the lines exceeding their area I implemented clipping constraints. This first
                required me to define the area of the quadrant in a similar way to that which I’d done previously. I
                used a push() and pop(), enabling me to introduce new rules inside. I then added clipping constraints
                which are defined within the new variable clip(), so that the lines stay within the quadrant.

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Step 8 — Increasing Spacing Between Lines</h3>
            <p>
                I needed to adjust the spacing between the lines so that it matched the other segments. Within the
                push()/pop() I added a new spacing rule e.g. let spacingBL = 25.

            <h3>Step 9 — Drawing vertical lines in bottom, right quadrant</h3>
            <p>
                Now I just needed to add the diagonal lines to the bottom right quadrant and went about doing this in a
                similar way to what I had done previously:

        <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
        <p>
            This is the final of the artist studies that I have completed for the 2D algorithmic art project. I am
            satisfied that I managed to recreate the reference with reasonable accurancy however, if I were to take it
            further, I would be interested in potentially implementing some movement within the image as I think this
            would really lend itself to the optical nature of Sol LeWitt's work.
