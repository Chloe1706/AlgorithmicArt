            <h3>Basic setup, functions and shapes </h3>
            <p>
                The earliest takeaway from learning to use p5.js was learning to set up the canvas; defining its
                parameters, calling a function e.g. draw() and drawing simple shapes such as circles or squares by
                looking at the p5.js references page.

            <h3>Let and While Loops</h3>
            <p>
                Let is used to define a value and is needed for creating ‘while’ loops.
                I’m still struggling to wrap my head around loops as a whole, particularly as they get more complex as
                you introduce more ‘let’ values. This is a simple implementation of a while loop:

            </p>
            <h3>For loops</h3>
            <p>The best way I can describe a ‘for’ loop with my limited technical knowledge is it seems to be a more
                condensed expression where the let and the incremental step are embedded within a single line of code.
                Below is an example of a simple while and for loop which both yeild the same result:

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Nested while loops</h3>
            <p>
                This technique introduces a 2nd variable for instance, Y as well as X. This is needed to plot drawings
                e.g. circles on a vertical and horizontal axis.

        <section class="step">
            <h3>Push() / Pop() and translate()</h3>
            <p>
                Push begins its own drawing group that contains its own styles and transformations and pop ends the
                drawing group. Within the following example I also experiment with translate(), a function that shifts
                everything that comes after according to new x and y coordinates.

            <h3>Random() and noLoop()</h3>
            <p>
                In class we created a looping function which fills the canvas with 50x50px squares. In addition to this,
                we introduced the ‘random’ attribute with the let ‘chosenColour’. This enabled us to input a range of
                colours which would be chosen at random to ‘fill’ each square. The noLoop() attribute is added to the
                setup function so that the act of choosing a random colour only happens once.

            <h3>Yayoi Kusama - Inspired art:</h3>
            <p>
                Using the techniques discussed so far; and, I think, partially inspired by all the circles, I
                created an
                algorithmic piece that responds to Yayoi Kusama’s artwork.
                The work uses a nested ‘while’ loop that fills the canvas with circles. However, within the nested
                loop
                there is a push/pop, inside which is a translate() function with its coordinates set to random. The
                effect of this is that random creates a small offset variation to the new drawing reference points
                introduced with translate, this creates a more organic structure where the circles aren't perfectly
                spaced.

            <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                My research for this project in addition to this experimentation has led me to want to focus more on
                recreating analog art with p5.js.
