                <p>I have already discussed Escher’s work within this project however it felt relevant to mention his
                    tessellation artworks again in context with the maths visualisation assignment. In particular, works
                    from his “Circle Limit” series which follows rules of hyperbolic geometry; (a system that provides a
                    mathematical framework for distortion and scaling where the pattern shrinks towards the edges).
                    Additionally, these works also utilise tessellation; an intrinsically mathematical process which
                    connects geometry and symmetry to create tiles that can fit together seamlessly over an infinite
                    plane.
                </p>

                <p>When tasked with researching artists and artworks that visualise mathematics, I first thought of
                    Escher. What makes his tessellations so memorable is they depict recognisable imagery. Escher's
                    process was one of intuition and experimentation. He would add a recognisable human dimension to an
                    otherwise simple and stark mathematics; visualising mammals, birds and sea creatures within the
                    tiles. This approach represents the perfect amalgamation of mathematics and visual art.

        <div class="content">
            <div class="text-block">

                <p>Hamid Naderi Yeganeh is a mathematical artist whose work closely aligns with p5.js. His practice
                    broadly utilises mathematical expressions such as trigonometric functions (sine, cosine etc),
                    fibonacci sequences, exponential functions and the saw tooth wave as its primary medium. He writes
                    programmes that evaluate these expressions and generate images.
                </p>

                <p>Like Escher, Naderi Yeganeh will search for meaningful imagery or motifs within the generative art
                    and submit these iterations for his artistic practice. An example of these can be seen here in the
                    artwork titled “Heart”. In this piece, the heart motif is rendered using hundreds of line segments
                    whose positions and orientations are determined by trigonometric equations, (equations that use
                    functions like sin, cos and tan to express an angle as numbers that can be used to plot lines of
                    shapes). This and many other works by Naderi Yeganeh adopt an iterative approach where something is
                    generated, and then the equations are tweaked until the work resembles something. I would argue that
                    works such as these are the contemporary answer to the blend of art and mathematics that was first
                    introduced by individuals like Escher.

        <h3>Exploring Polar Coordinates:</h3>
        <p>
            Before beginning this assignment, we had a workshop in which we explored polar coordinates with Diana. My
            grasp on mathematics is somewhat limited however she provided us with some equations to get started and I
            found that by experimentally altering the value within the equations, I could create interesting visual
            results.
        </p>

    <section class="step single-image">
        <h3>Tangent Functions</h3>
        <p>
            I began with the following equation: 𝑟 = 100 ∗ 𝑡𝑎𝑛(0.8∗𝜃), which was provided on the VLE. Unlike sin
            and cos which have a small range, tan has an infinite range meaning it can swing from small values to huge
            spikes in a positive or negative direction.
        </p>

        <p>This equation is added into a while loop. I added the variable ‘count’ which begins with the value of 0. This
            value increases incrementally and therefore changes the tan() value.</p>

        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>
            I added the mouseWheel function that behaves like an event listener with p5.js and responds when the user
            interacts with a scroll on a mouse or touchpad. This interaction is what increases the value of count and so
            as the user scrolls, the loop repeats and the shape shifts, forming this complex spiral.
        </p>

        <P>With the guidance of Diana, I made some minor adjustments to improve the scroll consistency of the mouse as I
            found that to begin with, when scrolling with the mouse wheel the image tended to jut forward. To resolve
            this, I implemented an if statement where if the value assigned to the scroll is more than five, it is
            reverted to five. This results in a smoother effect.
        </P>

        <h3>Final Visual Result:</h3>
        <p>
            The final result is able to be viewed in the 'Interactive Spiral' page. I am quite happy with the outcome
            as it formed the basis for the work I later produced in collaboration with the MA students in the Banking
            Hall project. Beyond this project, I am interested in developing more work which combines interactive,
            mathematical artwork with projection. In particular, I think it would be interesting to integrate techniques
            like this with projection mapping. Exploring the intersection of technology and contempory art and
            installation was a key motivation for me to take this course. I am exceited to develop these ideas further
            in future, self-defined projects.
