            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>I thought I would begin this documentation by first defining what a grid can be in conjunction
                with
                art. The research on this topic is grounded in the theoretical framework established in the 1979
                essay “Grids,” in which art historian and critic Rosalind Krauss critically explores the role of
                the
                grid in Modernist art.</p>

            <p>Krauss’s essay; ‘Grids’ alludes to the The grid as a symbol of modernity through its rejection of
                nature and emphasis on aesthetic order over imitation. This, broadly speaking, aligned with the
                sentiments held by numerous core modernist art movements, for instance; Cubism, Constructivism,
                De
                Stijl and many more.
            </p>

            <p>An alternative interpretation of a grid is a system in which the position of visual components
                are
                defined relative to one another, with the integration and repetition of a subject, flat colours,
                lines or shapes. To reiterate Krauss’s argument, grids of varying definitions play a significant
                role within modernist art as they contribute to the unifying goal of visual equilibrium and
                balance,
                in rejection of pure realism; held by movements that fall within Modernism.
            </p>

            <!-- transitional statement -->
            <p>All this to say that the term ‘grid’ can be flexible when used in context with art, however we
                can be
                certain that fundamentally it supports an aesthetic grounded in form and balance.</p>

                <p>Take Cubism for instance, where the grid rarely appears as a regular lattice; instead it operates as
                    an armature, underpinning the composition by organising fragmentation and assisting with relational
                    positioning.
                </p>

                <p>Ma Jolie, painted by Pablo Picasso between 1911 and 1912 during the height of Analytical Cubism,
                    exemplifies the idea of the grid as a structural logic that underpins the composition. Its purpose
                    is to sustain the fragmentation of the work while also providing some structural stability that
                    evokes a feeling of balance in an otherwise complex, non-hierarchal composition. Picasso’s work
                    anticipated what Krauss later identifies as the Modernist grid; a structural logic that contributes
                    to a visual equilibrium that, oftentimes may be more conceptual than visual in nature.
                </p>

                <p>Of course, there are more explicit use cases of the grid within Modernist Art. There is an argument
                    to be made that Cubism prepared the Modernist grid for later, more literal interpretations.

        <div class="content">
            <div class="text-block">

                <p>De Stijl was a Dutch art and design movement founded in 1917 which subscribed to a school of
                    thinking
                    by which artists and makers aimed to emphasise harmony and universality of colours and shapes.
                    Principly, it focused on simplifying art to its most basic elements; primarily featuring
                    geometric
                    shapes and lines, and primary colours. This abstraction by means of reduction and simplification
                    highlighted the relationships between form and colour.
                </p>

                <p>Piet Mondrian was one of the central figures of the De Stijl movement, through which he expanded
                    on
                    his manifesto: ‘Neo-plasticism’; a theoretical framework which rejects representation in art, in
                    favour of simplistic colors and lines to express visual harmony. This ideology was echoed in
                    Rosaling Krauss’s 1979 essay: ‘Grids’. Without tangenting too much, it will become important to
                    clarify at this stage that Mondrian’s grid was rooted in a metaphysical principle informed by
                    Theosophy, (particularly its doctrines surrounding ideas of pure harmony and search of spiritual
                    evolution). Mondrian's grid was a means to physically reconcile these ideas through his art.
                </p>

                <p>In relation to the grid, Mondrian externalised what Cubism kept latent and the grid became the
                    subject, not just the support. Crucially, the grid's purpose is to maintain visual equilibrium
                    however, the inclusion of thick black vertical and horizontal lines highlighted its integrity to
                    the
                    composition. Many works and movements to arise from modernism emphasise the idea of flatness
                    e.g.
                    non-hierarchal composition, which the grid facilitates. However a key distinction between
                    Mondrian
                    and Cubists such as Picasso is that in Cubist work, flatness is achieved through fragmentation
                    whereas, Mondrian and other artists of the De Stijl movement achieved flatness through clarity
                    and
                    reduction.
                </p>

                <p>Conceptually, many of the core ideas behind algorithmic and generative art echo what Mondrian was
                    doing by hand. Both share an emphasis on a parameter-based process of creation, where certain
                    rules
                    are laid out, for instance a limited colour palette and use of only orthogonal lines. This
                    functions
                    much like an algorithm where the outcome may vary slightly, however it will always abide by
                    these
                    predetermined parameters. Mondrian's commitment to visual equilibrium by means of his own strict
                    rules resulted in a repetition of similar compositions. This parallels how a generative system
                    can
                    produce infinite results from following a similar set of parameters.
                </p>

                    is

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>Maurits Cornelis Escher; or M.C Escher as he’s widely publicly known, was a Dutch artist whose
                    work
                    explored illusion, mathematics and perspective. Characterised as not belonging to a specific art
                    movement at its time, Escher’s work was embraced later by mathematicians, scientists and the
                    general
                    public for bridging art and logic and is credited for its influence over everything from
                    architecture to pop culture.
                </p>

                <p>How grids manifest in Escher's work challenges a lot of the earlier notions where instead of
                    drawn,
                    the structure is inferred through repetition of interlocking units. Significantly, we can see
                    here
                    an instance where representation returns and abstract forms are replaced by recognisable motifs.
                    The
                    implication of this is that the composition is no longer stripped of narrative or meaning in
                    place
                    of aesthetic balance; but rather, narrative and representation, and balance and flatness exist
                    in
                    synchrony.
                </p>

                <p>Specifically, Escher’s tesselations test the grids capacity to accommodate recognisable forms
                    whilst
                    still preserving a visual equilibrium and characteristic flatness. It is able to achieve this in
                    examples like the one attached here because each figure functions as equal molecules with no
                    foreground/background hierarchy and repetition and symmetry serve to flatten and balance the
                    visual
                    field. It is also facilitated by the mathematical precision with which Escher is associated.
                </p>

                <p>A key differentiating factor between Mondrian and Escher and their individual purpose of the grid
                    is
                    that while Mondrian's motivations were rooted in spiritual grounding, Escher’s motivations were
                    procedural and rooted in logic and mathematics. Escher is generally excluded from Modernist
                    canon
                    despite his technical sophistication. This is in part due to the fact he reintroduces subject
                    depiction and violates certain Modernist taboos, placing him adjacent to Modernism as opposed to
                    within it.
                </p>

                <p>However, not too dissimilarly from Mondrian, Escher’s tessellation works could be described as
                    algorithmic in a non-digital sense. If we were to define an algorithm in analog art as, a finite
                    set
                    of rules or parameters that, when repeatedly applied, generates a structured outcome; Escher’s
                    polygonal tessellations follow a contingent logic that by its nature, could be likened to
                    algorithmic logic. Crucially, for this reason, Mondrian and Escher were both intriguing case
                    studies
                    for exploring the intersection of grids and algorithms within traditional media.
                </p>

                <!-- transitonal statement -->
                <p>However, This leads me onto to discuss my final case study in which the grid is elevated to a
                    narrative device: Yayoi Kusama.

                <p>Contrary to other artists mentioned, Kusama’s flatness, which is facilitated by grids, is used as a
                    coping device. In order to understand the intent behind gridded works such as her Infinity Nets, we
                    first have to dissect the narrative and psychological framework behind them. Her work is not
                    symbolic, but rather a condition and manifestation of her self-described hallucinations in which she
                    sees fields of multiplying patterns. Kusama herself describes this experience as
                    ‘self-obliterating’.
                </p>

                <p>Through mark making, Kusama’s grid emerges organically as she externalises her internal experience.
                    If Picasso’s grid stabilises composition, Mondrian’s grid is tied to the universal order; with
                    respects to his theosophic beliefs. And Escher’s grid is tied to procedural logic. Kusama’s grid is
                    a reenactment of her condition, as the canvas becomes a record of lived psychic intensity. The
                    result is a flat composition with no visual hierarchy which could be likened to the previous
                    examples; however, the means by which the artist arrives at the outcome are entirely different.
                </p>

                <p>Rosaling Krauss characterises the grid as a structure that enforced flatness, balance and neutrality.
                    At first glance, Kusama’s Infinity Nets appear to conform to this logic however, upon closer
                    examination, they reveal the grid’s paradoxical nature, maintaining formal flatness and balance
                    while simultaneously they are imbued with subjectivity and psychic intensity; as Kusama presents the
                    grid as a site where structural order and lived experience collide.

            <p>My hope is that through this research and case study analysis, I have presented that the grid is not
                a single form, but a shifting conceptual framework whose meaning depends on the context of its
                grounding. It simultaneously is and is not a neutral structure. When analysed in purely formal
                terms, it serves to flatten, balance and neutralise composition. However, it has the capacity to
                absorb ideology, metaphysics, mathematics and psychology depending on the artists who deploys it.
                This adaptability helps explain the grid's persistence in algorithmic and generative art where it
                reemerges as a procedural logic; most akin to Escher’s practice, through which form is produced. In
                such contexts, the grid operates as a rule based system capable of generating variation while still
                maintaining structural coherence under strict parameters, expanding on the grid's historical role
                within visual art. </p>
